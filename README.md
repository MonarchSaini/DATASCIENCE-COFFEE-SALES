## Project Description: Coffee Sales Time Series Analysis

**Objective:**

To uncover patterns, trends, and anomalies within coffee sales data to inform strategic business decisions. This analysis focused on time-series aspects, exploring next-day, week, and month sales predictions, as well as specific customer purchasing behaviors.

**Methodology:**

1. **Data Exploration and Cleaning:**
   * **Data Ingestion:** Imported coffee sales data, including transaction dates, quantities, product types, and customer information.
   * **Data Cleaning:** Handled missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies to ensure data integrity.
   * **Feature Engineering:** Created new features like time-based aggregations (e.g., daily, weekly, monthly sales) and customer purchase frequency.

2. **Time Series Analysis:**
   * **Decomposition:** Broken down time series into trend, seasonality, and residual components to understand underlying patterns.
   * **Stationarity:** Checked for stationarity and applied transformations (e.g., differencing) if necessary.
   * **Forecasting:** Utilized various time series forecasting models (e.g., ARIMA, Prophet) to predict future sales at different time horizons (next day, week, month).

3. **Customer Behavior Analysis:**
   * **Segmentation:** Grouped customers based on purchasing patterns (e.g., high-frequency buyers, low-value customers).
   * **RFM Analysis:** Evaluated customer recency, frequency, and monetary value to identify valuable segments.
   * **Churn Prediction:** Developed models to predict customer churn and identify factors influencing retention.

4. **Visualization:**
   * **Time Series Plots:** Created visualizations to explore trends, seasonality, and anomalies in sales data.
   * **Customer Segmentation Plots:** Depicted customer segments based on purchasing behavior.
   * **Forecasting Plots:** Presented predicted sales trends alongside actual data.

**Key Findings:**

* **Seasonal Patterns:** Identified seasonal fluctuations in sales, particularly during holidays and specific times of the day.
* **Trend Analysis:** Observed increasing or decreasing trends in overall sales over time, indicating growth or decline in business.
* **Customer Segmentation:** Discovered distinct customer segments with varying purchasing habits and preferences.
* **Predictive Modeling:** Developed accurate models for forecasting future sales and predicting customer churn.

**Business Implications:**

* **Optimized Inventory Management:** Informed inventory planning based on predicted sales patterns and seasonal demand.
* **Targeted Marketing Campaigns:** Developed tailored marketing strategies for different customer segments to increase customer engagement and retention.
* **Improved Customer Service:** Identified at-risk customers and implemented strategies to improve customer satisfaction and reduce churn.

**Conclusion:**

This project successfully leveraged time series analysis and customer behavior analysis to gain valuable insights into coffee sales data. The findings provided a solid foundation for data-driven decision-making and business optimization.
